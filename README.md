# 🔐 Login Page UI

This is a **simple and responsive Login Page UI** built using **HTML and CSS only**. It features a modern card-style layout with a smooth gradient background, clean typography, and a prominent login form design.

> 📌 JavaScript is not used in this project as I am currently in the learning phase — this project was built to strengthen my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling.
